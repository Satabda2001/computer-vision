For this following repository I have made use of these amazing resources - 

1. OpenCV Course by freeCodeCamp.org - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
2. OpenCV Official Documentation - [Doc](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.3/)
3. Jason's OpenCV Repo - [GitHub](https://github.com/jasmcaus/opencv-course)

The [`basics.py`](https://github.com/souvik0306/computer-vision/blob/master/basics.py) file contain a few rudimentary OpenCV functions to play around with.
