## Computer-Vision
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.
From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do

The [`basics.py`](https://github.com/souvik0306/computer-vision/blob/master/basics.py) file contain a few rudimentary OpenCV functions to play around with like - 
- Rescaling and Resizing Images & Videos
- BGR Image to Grayscale Conversion
- Simple Shape Creation
- Edge Cascading
- Canny Image Creation
- Bluring Images & Videos

For this following repository I have made use of some amazing resources - 

1. OpenCV Course by freeCodeCamp.org - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
2. OpenCV Official Documentation - [Doc](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.3/)
3. Jason D'Souza's OpenCV Repository - [GitHub](https://github.com/jasmcaus/opencv-course)
